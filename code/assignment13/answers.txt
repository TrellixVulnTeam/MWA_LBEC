1. What is Node
Node is a JavaScript server-side platform, the mains process is single threaded but in background uses multiple threads to execute asynchronous code, Processing model mainly inspired by JavaScript Event-based model with JavaScript callback mechanism, node is fast and scalable. 
Node is non-blocking which means that all functions ( callbacks ) are delegated to the event loop and they are ( or can be ) executed by different threads.


2- What is the Event-Loop in Node?
JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
Whenever we run a Node program, a thread is automatically created. This thread is the only place where our entire codebase is going to be executed. this thread is called Event-Loop.
The role of this loop is to schedule which operations our only thread should be performing at any given point in time


3- Based on what we learned so far what are the differences between AngularJS and Angular?
angularJS
Model View-Controller
javascript
You can create the structure how you want

Angular
No model view-controller
typescript
has model and components
by default is created under own structure, src folder for example has the main code files related with the angular application
